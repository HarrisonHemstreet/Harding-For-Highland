								<p><strong>Highland is a unique city. <em>Planning Our Future Together</em> we can keep it that way.</strong></p>
								<p>
									My husband and I have been married for 38 years. We have 5 married sons and 10 wonderful 
									grandchildren. We love living in the beautiful city of Highland because of its small town 
									feel with its parks, trails, and scenic views.   
									<br>
									<br>
									I earned my degree in International Relations from BYU. I am a pianist and flautist and have 
									taught piano for more than 25 years.  My ability to lead has been cultivated by my life 
									experiences. Living in many cities throughout the United States and overseas, I have seen 
									how policy can positively or negatively impact a community.
									<br>
									<br>
									I have served in many leadership positions in my church as well as my community and at my children’s 
									schools. My continued desire to serve led me to attend Highland City Council Meetings, where I have 
									listened to and learned about the challenges facing Highland today. Water, open space, and zoning are 
									just a few of these challenges.  I am committed to addressing these issues and listening to your views. 
									We can achieve our goals by Planning Our Future Together.

								<h2 class="major">Issues</h2>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Water</strong>: Let’s do our part to conserve.</li>
									<li><strong>Open Space</strong>: Each neighborhood is unique. Let’s put policies in place that will be equitable to all.</li>
									<li><strong>Zoning</strong>: Let’s develop with Highland’s General Plan in mind. (low density) Let’s keep residential roads safe.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>
									Water, open space, and zoning are just a few of the issues residents should be looking at.
								</p>
								<p>
									I think one of the most important issues we will be facing is water. Water is going to be an on-going issue as the population of Utah is predicted to double by 2065.  During the same time period the population in Utah County alone is predicted to increase by 1 million residents.  This is according to the Kem C Gardner Public Policy Institute.  Although it may seem like the increase in populations is all coming from people moving in from out of state, in reality, 67% of these new residents are our children and grandchildren. While our population is increasing, our water resources will remain the same. That means we will have to make some modifications to our water use, and the way we think about water in the future, if we want our children and grandchildren to be able to live here. 
								</p>
								<p>
									One such modification request came in June when the Highland pressurized irrigation supervisor presented the current water situation at the City Council Meeting.  He first talked about our drought situation and stressed that we needed to take some conservation measures. He showed graphs and tables indicating that Highland residents used far more pressurized irrigation water than our neighboring cities. He pointed out that Saratoga Springs uses 2.6 acre/feet /acre, Orem uses 4.3 acre/feet/acre and Highland uses 6.2 acre/feet /acre. That really caught my attention, so I decided to research what exactly those numbers meant. Here’s basically what they mean. If you put a waterproof enclosure all around your lawn and watered your lawn as usual from April 15 to Oct 15 and you lived in Saratoga Springs the water would be 2.6 feet deep, in Orem 4.3 feet deep, and if you lived in Highland you would have 6.2 feet of water in the enclosure. 
								</p>
								<p>
									To put that into perspective a farmer growing alfalfa, a very water intensive plant, uses about 3 feet of water per year and gets 3 cuttings. So, by basically educating ourselves on the way we think about water and how we use it, we could cut our water use and still have attractive yards.	
								</p>
								<p>
									But back to the one modification we made in June, Highland City residents were sent a small postcard in the mail asking them to please reduce their watering times by 30%. In the Beacon Hill area there was a pump that was not working at full capacity and was unable to keep up with the water demand for the residents there. The reservoir was losing about ½ a foot a day. But after the postcards were sent out the water demand lessened and the reservoir leveled off. What this means is that the residents of Beacon Hill responded to the request to conserve. This is the kind of team work that will help Utah and Highland in planning for the future.
								</p>
								<p>
									I spoke with Andy Spencer, our City Engineer, in July, a few weeks after the first conservation postcards were sent out to see if there was any data to confirm whether or not the residence had complied with the request to conserve water. It was disappointing news. While the Beacon Hill incident brought a glimmer of hope to the possibility that residents had complied, the data showed minimal support for compliance. There was a possible 1-3 percent improvement, which is not nothing, but certainly not even close to what was being asked. There will be much work to do. Meters will certainly be advantageous to help residents to see what they are actually using which will help them to adjust their use. The state is requiring meters on all pressurized irrigation and Highland is in the process of trying to secure meters. This will be an important step forward as we strive to find solutions to this issue for our city, state, and region.
								</p>
								<p>
									Open Space has been an issue for quite some time now. I’m very proud of the current City Council for their courage in trying to remedy this issue one property at a time. This issue will be on the ballot on Nov 2nd in regards to the Wimbleton trail referendum which could set a precedent for future trail removal. I am committed to keeping our Open Space and trails and doing our best to maintain them to a high standard.
								</p>
								<p>
									Zoning continues to be an issue. As Highland is nearing build out we want to make sure that we keep the General Plan in mind which is low density housing but also be proactive in bringing in new commercial businesses to our commercial zones. Safety on our roads should always be considered as we plan our community.
								</p>
								<p>
									I am committed to addressing these issues and listening to your views.
								</p>
								<p>
									Why should voters consider me as their choice for Highland City Council?
								</p>
								<p>
									I have the time, the interest, the background and the capability. I have the time to listen and communicate with the residents. I know that this city belongs to them. I want my decisions to reflect their desires. I have shown my interest by attending City Council Meetings and learning about the issues facing Highland today. I have my Bachelor’s degree in International Relations and lifelong desire to serve as my background as well as my lived experience. My leadership roles in my home, my church and my community show that I am very capable. I will also be fiscally responsible and plan for the future. I want to make sure that our tax dollars are spent as efficiently as possible. I will do my homework on issues and be prepared for City Council.  I know that Planning Our Future Together, we can make things happen.
