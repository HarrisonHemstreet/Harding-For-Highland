								<p><strong>Highland is a unique city. <em>Planning Our Future Together</em> we can keep it that way.</strong></p>
								<p>
									My husband and I have been married for 38 years. We have 5 married sons and 
									10 wonderful grandchildren. We love living in the beautiful city of Highland
									 because of its small town feel with its parks, trails, and scenic views.  
									 <br>
									 <br>
									I earned my degree in International Relations from BYU. I’ve taught piano for 
									more than 25 years.  My ability to lead has been cultivated by my life experiences. 
									Living in many cities throughout the United States and overseas, I have seen how good 
									policy can help a community and how bad can hurt. I have served the youth and women of 
									my church in many leadership positions as well as my community at my children’s schools. 
									My continued desire to serve led me to attend Highland City Council Meetings where I have 
									listened to and learned about the challenges facing Highland today. Water, open space, and 
									zoning are just a few of these challenges.  I am committed to addressing these issues and 
									listening to your views. We can achieve our goals by Planning Our Future Together.
